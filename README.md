README.md 
========================================================
README for the *Getting and Cleaning Data* class project for the Johns Hopkins Data Science specialization on Coursera. 

Repo Contents: 
* README.md
  * This file, describes the procedures used in run_analysis.R script to transformed the raw data into a tidy dataset.
* run_analysis.R  
  * R script. Transforms the raw data into a tidy data (tidy.txt file).  
* CodeBook.md  
  * Code book for the tidy dataset generated by run_analysis.R. Explains the data organization and variable definitions. 

### Required R Packages  
The following package is required to run the script.   
* dplyr    

### The run_analysis.R Script Operation Overview
This script summarizes the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset* which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. The original data represents information collected from the accelerometers of a smartphone. A full description is available at the site linked above.
The original data was divided into "traning" and "test" sets. The run_analysis.R script combines both these datasets and produces a tidy dataset *tidy.txt* as described in the CodeBook.md file. In summary, the script implements these tasks:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### The run_analysis.R Script Operation Details  
After unziping the raw dataset to the working directory, 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder is created that contains the data sets. The run_analysis.R  code assumes the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder is in the current working directory. Change working directory accordingly if not.

1. 	Training Set is Imported to a data frame df_train
2. 	Test Set is Imported to a data frame df_test
In steps 1, and 2. above, activity numbers are replaced with its associated activity string according to the activity_labels.txt file. "Subject" and "Activity" columns are added by importing the associated files in the train and test drectories.

3.  A training/test column is added to allow us to identify the provenance of each data row.
4.	The test set and training set data frames are merged into a df_combined data frame.
5.  Using the features.txt information, the script names the column variables in the combined dataframe.
6.  Uses the dplyr package to summarize the results:
	Selects only the columns with mean and std 
	Groups by Subject, Activity 
	Summarizes each group by calaculating the mean for each of the variables
	
Note: Problem is ambiguous as to whether "mean" can be any part of the variable name.
In this script, I decided to use only names with 'std()' and 'mean()' so it returns the same number of elements for each (33). 
An alternate 'select' statement is proviced if user wants *any* variable with 'mean' or 'std' in the name

7. Finally, the resulting tidy set i written into a tidy.txt file. The cript uses write.table() defaults.
 User can read the data set with: read.table("tidy.txt", header = TRUE)
